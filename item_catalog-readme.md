### Using The Program:
Go to https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip
to download the needed news database. Unzip the database to the same directory as the logs_analysis2 Python program
With Python3 and psycopg2 installed, the user will need to be in
the same directory in which the logs_analysis2.py program is located. When in the
same directory as the logs_analysis program, run this command:
  python3 logs_analysis2.py
