Hello! This web application should be accessible at 54.184.75.80 on ssh port 22 (Amazon Lightsail would not allow custom SSH ports),
using the username of "grader". The password for the user "grader" is "grader".

So the login from the command line would be:

"ssh -i [location of grader ssh key] grader@54.184.75.80"

Then there should be a prompt for the password of "grader" as an extra security precaution.
